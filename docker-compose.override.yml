      # Mount the app code into the app containers:
      - .:${PWD:-/srv/arrow-challenge}

      # After mounting the app code, we will use volumes to store the project's
      # gem libraries and node modules.

      # In the case of the gem libraries, the "gem_bundle" volume will be
      # initialized with the development image's installed gems. Gems can be
      # added later during the development process without re-building the
      # development image:
      - gem_bundle:/usr/local/bundle

      # In the case of the node modules, the "node_modules" volume will also be
      # initialized with the development image's installed node modules. Also,
      # notice how we're mounting the "node_modules" volume *inside* the mounted
      # source code, effectively replacing any contents you might have on your
      # project's "node_modules" folder in the container, offering several
      # advantages:
      # - We can run the frontend app either from the host (i.e. macOS) or
      #   using containers without having the host & container clobber the npm
      #   each other's packages, or avoid conflicting versions for macOS / Linux
      # - Speeds up the npm operations on the container when running on
      #   macOS/Windows, since a local volume bind on mac/win is significantly
      #   slower than a Docker volume, and node module install is very sensitive
      #   to I/O performance
